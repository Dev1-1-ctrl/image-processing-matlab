# Image Processing (MATLAB) — University Coursework

## Overview
This repository contains MATLAB scripts created for a university Image Processing assignment.
Each script file represents a separate task/exercise from the coursework.

## Files
- Taska.m
- Taskb.m
- Taskc.m
- Taskd.m
- Taske.m
- Taskf.m
- Taskg.m
- Taskh.m
- Taski.m

## Requirements
- MATLAB (any recent version)
- Image Processing Toolbox (recommended, depending on functions used)

## How to Run
1. Download/clone this repository
2. Open MATLAB and set the folder as the current directory
3. Run any script from the Command Window, for example:
   - `Taska`
   - `Taskb`

## Notes
- If the scripts expect input images, place them in the same folder (or update paths inside the code).
- This is an academic project included to demonstrate MATLAB and image processing fundamentals.
